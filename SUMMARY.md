- Thanks to Pranas's hack friday efforts and the data aspect sharing their genius ideas, TeamOS now have a TeamOS - WDYD? topic in the loop/team-os stream. This is where our team-osBot posts a summary (or changelog!) of what we're working on and reminds us to keep it updated / post to the all hands call. This is part of our efforts to increase visibility to the team on what TeamOS are planning, doing and have done. So here is what TeamOS is currently up to:

- Contract amendments completed
  - Note that @maggie0002 has now moved to a full-time contract, glad to have you focusing on balena 100% Arran :)
  
- Finalising parental leave plans for balenistas soon to go on parental leave, sorting arrangments and logistics

- All-hands docs for Feb have been created and added to the calendar events

- Defining TeamOS workflow - we now have a
  - Trello board for everything we're working on (improvements, ideas, tasks, admin. etc) - this has a restricted view so we can keep all tasks, whether they contain sensitive info or not, together in one place so we have full visibility as a team on our work
  - Weekly planning sync / check in on Tuesday 
  - [TeamOS - What Do You Do? repo](https://github.com/people-os/team-os-wdyd) to interface with and give visibility to the whole team - this is where our versioned changelog live.
  - [(Work In Progress) Processes repo](https://github.com/orgs/people-os/repositories) - for documenting how we work, our TeamOS processes 
 
- Begin documenting processes in people-os github repo so we have a single source of truth that is versioned for everything. 

- Starting to meet 1:1 with team members to hear about their experiences and what the internal support structure can look like in the future. 

- Begin developing and improving resources for the team, including
  - Creating a balena 101 resource that includes tutorials and documentation for upskilling and sharing balena context
  - Creating tools that help enable autonomous working, decision making and the ability to self serve
  - Improving existing and creating new policies that can easily be referred to for guidance
  - Updating and reorganizing the structure of Handbook to improve the team's experience (Hack-Friday Project)
  - Restructuring Google Drive and working on a file sharing spec (Hack-Friday Project)

- Adjust to our new workflow! :) we're having to relearn, transfer across work and change our working habits to fit with our new and improved workflow, we're hugely grateful for your patience whilst we're figuring it out. Using Github for day to day is a new learning experience for us so we'll be taking some time to get comfortable and up to speed. Whatever tutorials / training we create for this will be shared in the handbook for the whole team to use.
