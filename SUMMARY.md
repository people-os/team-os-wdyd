**TeamOS has been:**

  3. imrpove data quality for improved and more accurate analysis

* Mapping out "where" everyone is doing work within the TeamOS loop to identify what needs to be priortized or where there is a need for support.

* Making Trello board updates for patterns, improvements, ideas, tasks, admin, etc. _(this has a restricted view so we can keep all tasks, whether they contain sensitive info or not, together in one place so we have full visibility as a team on our work)_

* A new [people-os/team-os-processes](https://github.com/people-os/team-os-processes) repo has been created in github - this will follow the same format as others balena docs repos.
