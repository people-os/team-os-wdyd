- Thanks to Pranas's hack friday efforts and the data aspect sharing their genius ideas, TeamOS now have a TeamOS - WDYD? thread in the loop/team-os. This is where our team-osBot posts a summary (or changelog!) of what we're working on and reminds us to keep it updated / post to the all hands call. This is part of our efforts to increase visibility to the team on what TeamOS are planning, doing and have done.
- Defining TeamOS workflow - we now have a
  - Trello board for everything we're working on (improvements, ideas, tasks, admin. etc) - this has a restricted view so we can keep all tasks, whether they contain sensitive info or not, together in one place so we have full visibility as a team on our work
  - Weekly planning sync / check in on Tuesday 
  - [TeamOS - What Do You Do? repo](https://github.com/people-os/team-os-wdyd) to interface with and give visibility to the whole team - this is where our versioned changelog live.
  - [(Work In Progress) Processes repo](https://github.com/orgs/people-os/repositories) - for documenting how we work, our TeamOS processes 
- Begin documenting processes in people-os github repo so we have a single source of truth that is versioned for everthing. 
- Adjust to our new workflow! :) we're having to relearn, transfer across work and change our working habits to fit with our new and improved workflow, we're hugely grateful of your patience whilst we're figuring it out. Using Github for day to day is a new learning experience for us so we'll be taking some time to get comfortable and up to speed. Whatever tutorials / training we create for this will be shared in the handbook for the whole team to use.
